# Medical Image Processing	

Below are some tutorials for deep learning. I put the links here instead of on Bitbucket in case someone has no access to Bitbucket yet.

1. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html </br>
This is a free online book teaching you neural networks and deep learning.
2. https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/22493551 </br>This is a tutorial in Chinese on Zhihu telling some basic concepts of CNN, such as pooling layer, activation function and etc.
3. https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/ </br>This is a tutorial written by an undergraduate student in UCLA. I think it provides clear explanation of how neural network works for image processing intuitively. It could be a good reference.
4. https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python </br>It is a tutorial of implementing neural networks with Keras, including installing Keras. 
5. https://playground.tensorflow.org/ </br>It is a NN playground provided by Tensorflow. You could train a neural network in your browser and see what will go on. By choosing some different filters, you could see how the network does regression or classification jobs.
6. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning </br>It is an introductory course provided by Dr. Andrew Ng in Stanford University. You could sign up for Coursera and audit the course for free. It provides some basics about machine learning but it doesn't have many contents about neural networks. If you would like to know more about neural networks by taking an online course. I personally recommend CS231n provided by Prof. Fei-fei Li in Stanford University.
7. https://keras.io/ </br> This is the documentation for Keras. Keras is an interface based on Tensorflow, Theano or Pytorch backends. It is much easier to implement a neural network with Keras. Basically you only need to add the layers sequentially and load the data to train it.
8. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/</br> This is a tutorial provided by Tensorflow about how to get start with it.
